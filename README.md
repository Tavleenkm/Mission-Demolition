# Mission Demolition

## Overview

Mission Demolition is an exciting physics-based destruction game where players use a slingshot to launch projectiles at castles and achieve various objectives. With each level, the challenge escalates, providing a fun and engaging gameplay experience inspired by classic artillery games.

Players must complete levels by meeting certain objectives, such as hitting targets or achieving a high score, while managing a limited number of shots and racing against the clock.

## How to Play

Aim: Use your mouse to aim the slingshot at the target.

Launch: Click and drag to charge the slingshot, and release the mouse to launch a projectile.

Objective: Try to hit the target castles to proceed to the next level.

Timer: Complete the level objectives before the timer runs out!

## Game Features

Multiple Levels: Progress through different levels, each featuring new castle layouts and challenges.

Timer Mechanic: Added to increase the challenge, players must complete each level before time runs out. This addition makes gameplay more dynamic and tests both precision and speed.

Score Tracking: Keep track of the shots taken and strive to finish each level with as few attempts as possible.

Camera Switching: Follow the projectile closely or zoom out to see the entire battlefield.

## Added Features to Make the Game More Interesting

To enhance gameplay, a timer feature was added to each level. Players are given a set amount of time (e.g., 60 seconds) to complete the level objectives. If the timer runs out, it's game over! This addition not only adds urgency and challenge to each level but also encourages players to make quick, strategic shots to complete their objectives efficiently.
